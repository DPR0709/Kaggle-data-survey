# Kaggle-data-survey
exploring the kaggle data survey through a tutorial


In this notebook learnt on how to draw insights such that all the enthusiasts in our community get a better understanding of the field, the different jobs that work with data and what do they actually do in their day-to-day work. It also gives students a better insight into what technologies are used and hopefully will empower them with the information to help them break into some of these fields.
